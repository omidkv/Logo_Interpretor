# Logo_Interpretor
Haskell Logo Interpretor
This project was a final class assignment completed by Kevin Omidvaran and Arthur Napolitano. The way the program takes in logo in the
form or scheme and interprets it. After running the executible one needs to only type in one of the following to select the scheme code. 

The list is as follows:
"starfish"
"stars" 
"koch" 
"hilbert" 
"fancy"
"tree" 
"lissajous" 
"hexfield" 
"broccoli" 
"circles"

Unfortunatly on each instance of the program only one can be selected.

This program demonstrates the use of the state monad, maybe monad.

Lines 286 to 304 show examples of the scheme logo code that is being interpreted.
